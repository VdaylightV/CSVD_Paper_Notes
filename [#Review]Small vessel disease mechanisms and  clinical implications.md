## Abstract

- **Small Vessel Disease:** 

  A disorder of cerebral microvessels that causes white matter hyperintensity and several other common abnormalities seen on brain imaging

  - A common cause of stroke and vascular dementia

- **The existed research:**

  Several manifestation of cerebral microvessel endothelial dysfunction

  - blood-brain barrier dysfuncition
  - impaired vasodilation 
  - vessel stiffening
  - dysfunction blood flow
  - interstitial fluid drainage
  - white matter rarefaction
  - ischaemia
  - inflammation
  - myelin damage
  - secondary neurodegeneration

  More dynamic and widespread than previously thought

- **Challenge:**

  - The underlying pathogenesis that CSVD causing stroke and vascular dementia is poorly understood.

  - Relations between lesions and symptoms are highly variable but poorly understood
  - The determination of 
    - which vascular dysfunctions are most important in pathogenesis
    - which abnormalities are reversible
    - why lesion progression and symptomatology are so variable
  
- **Meaning:**

  The knowledge will help to 

  - identify potential targets for intervention
  - improve risk prediction for individuals with small vessel disease

## Introduction

- **Small Vessel Disease:**

  A disorder of brain's small perforating 

  -  arterioles
  - capillaries
  - venules

  that causes various lesions

  > Lesions can be seen by 
  >
  > - pathological examination
  > - brain imaging with MRI or CT
  >
  > <u>Common Lesions:</u>
  >
  > - white matter hyperintensities 
  >
  >   The origin of white matter hyperintensities is believed to be **vascular origin**.
  >   
  > - lacunes
  >
  > - microbleeds
  >
  > - superficial siderosis
  >
> > siderosis——铁锈病
  >
  > - perivascular spaces
  >
  > - microinfarcts
  >
  >   > microinfarcts——微梗塞
  >
  > <u>The lesions recently found:</u>
  >
  > - small subcortical infarcts
  > - intracerebral haemorrhage——presented by stroke
  
- **Problems of Lesions:**

  - They can be <u>clinically silent individually</u> and patients can experience no symptoms
  - The combinations of lesions can lead to some diseases
    - cognitive impairment
    - dementia
    - depression
    - mobility problems
    - higher risk of stroke and worse outcome
  - The clinical presentations have been **considered separately** in research and clinic
  - Patients with those presentations have been referred to separated stroke, cognition, or mobility clinics

- **The harm of CSVD:**

  - causes about a quarter of ischaemic strokes
  - causes most haemorrhagic strokes
  - commonest cause of vascular dementia
  - often occurs with Alzheimer's disease
  - worsens the resulting cognitive impairment

  > <u>The CSVD contributing to 50% of dementias worldwide.</u>

- **The use of MRI:**

  - Some <u>sensitive MRI methods can show that pathological changes</u> occur in so-called normal appearing **white matter** and **grey matter**.

  - Some MRI methods are exquisitely sensitive to **small changes in fluid content**.

    > The white matter hyperintensities partly or in their early stages
    >
    > - represent areas of increased interstitial fluid not just demyelination

- **The diversity of CSVD:**
  - rare familial forms
  - common sporadic forms——The commonest clinically recognised form
  - different subtypes
